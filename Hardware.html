            <td class="am-description">Basically a motherboard contains many of the components that make up a computer, including the central processing unit (CPU), the computerâ€™s memory and all the connectors for input and output devices. They are also made of many interchangeable parts that function together to help information flow: interface chips for memory, power connectors, for power distribution, slots to store files, and etc.They have a purpose of allowing information to flow. For example, computers use RAMs to run applications, but that would be impossible without a Motherboard carrying the information. The processing abilities in Motherboards can depend on four main storages/sizes: ATX, micro-ATX, flex-ATX and mini-ITX.

            <td class="am-description">CPU stands for Central Processing Unit: Another name for a CPU is known as a microprocessor. A CPU is the brains of a computer, it fetches program instructions from RAM, interprets and processes it and then sends back the computed results to carry out instructions. In other words a CPU receives data, decodes it, and then sends it out. A CPU consists of high quantities of silicone dioxide to allow information to flow. A CPU so important that without it using computer software would almost be impossible since information will not flow.

            <td class="am-description">Random Access Memory: This is the place in a computing device where the operating system, application programs and data in current use are kept so that they can be quickly reached by a processor. The RAM is much faster to read from and write to than other kinds of storage in a computer, such as a hard drives. In other words, this is, your computer's short time memory, which temporarily stores important data or information while the computer is working. The computer's operating system needs a sufficient amount of memory to keep the computer running. The more RAM a computer has, the more efficiently the programs can run. So computers need rams to operate!</td>

            <td class="am-description">Storage is the main responsibiliy of a hard drive. It is the component of a computer that stores everything you keep on your computer. Not just files, pictures, documents, music, and videos. Your programs, your preferences, even your operating are all stored on your hard drive! We need hard drives to store data, otherwise you cannot download anything on your computer.</td>

            <td class="am-description">A bus, in computing, is a set of physical connections (cables, printed circuits, etc.) which can be shared by components in order to communicate with one another. The purpose of buses is to reduce the number of "pathways" needed for communication between the components, by carrying out all communications over a single data channel. You can think a BUS system is like an actual Bus/Train running in your computer traveling in different routes. Bus systems help shorten a complicated system of communication and are essential in our computers. </td>

            <td class="am-description">Keyboards are a set of panel keys that we use to compute. Moving a mouse along a flat surface can move the on-screen cursor to different items on the screen. Items can be moved or selected by pressing the mouse buttons (called clicking). Finally the monitor usually comprises the display device, circuitry, casing, and power supply. Monitors can be thought of as screens that display what the internal computer is showing. Finally, All of these are components that help us use our Computers!!!</td>
