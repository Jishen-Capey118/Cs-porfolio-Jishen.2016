        <h2>"This website was made as a tutorial system to teach even the most inexperienced users about how to build a Calculator on  one HTML page by using style and script elements."</h2>
            </div></br>
<div class="am-description">STEP 1 <p>I first recommend that users follow this format. It first says < !DOCTYPE.HTML > so that the system knows that this is HTML. Next < html> < head> < body> are all organized in a way so that headings can be made first with paragraphs later. However THIS IS JUST THE SKELETON, you WILL need different codes for different elements such as headings, Paragraphs, etc (< head > < h1 >,< p >, etc...), but do not worry, we will get to those later on. </div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/htmlbegin.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 2 <p>Next we need to use this format to make < style > < / style > tages, but I recommend saving this part of the code until the end, because this < style > tag will be used like a CSS page in the html to help edit the page. </div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/htmlJava2.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 3 <p> HTML is composed of a tree of HTML elements and other nodes, such as text nodes. Each element can have HTML attributes specified. First we will use a < ul > < ul > element which is a tag that defines a hyperlink that is used to link from one page to another. Inside we will link our page to other pages, so that once each one is clicked we can acess other pages we have made. href="" is telling the system that we want to link our website to the other website with its .html link. Also it isn't required to type text between the title elements, but I enjoy naming my work! </p></div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/htmlJava3.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 4 <p>When I made my Calculator I decided to add a nice large heading that says Calculator. In order to do so, inside of a < h1 > tag I typed class= "heading" which names the text and then I typed CALCULATOR. Later on in the < styles tag I typed .heading (which is the h1's name) to edit it in whatever way I desired. </p></div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/htmlJava4.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 5 <p> For this step I used an input tag < input >, because it specifies an input field where the user can enter data. Then inside the placeholder I typed "Enter the first number". This is making a type in area in order for users to type in their first number for the calculator. </div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/htmlJava5.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 6 <p>For this step, based on my Calculator's Layout, I chose to repeat step 5 by using the input tag. Inside the placeholder I typed "Enter the Second Number." </div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/htmlJava5.5.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 7 <p> Between both inputs (between step 5 and step 6) I recommend using The < select > element which used to create a drop-down list with many < option > tags inside the < select > element so they can the available options in the list. Since this is a calculator all of the options need to be math based operations such as addition and subtraction. I recommend typing < option value="(1 operation such addition) > with its symbols. </div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/htmlJava6.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 8 <p>Now our calculator needs a button! Inside a < button > element you can put content, like text or images. This is the difference between this element and buttons created with the < input > element. Inside the button name must be entered such as Calculate. After that I decided to put the answer inside of a < div > element, so the answer can appear on the bottom. This is just a recommendation, but < alert  tags may also be used. </div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/htmlJava7.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 8.5 <p>This is what the Calculator should look like!</div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/htmlJava7.5.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 9 <p> Since we adhere to make the entire calculator on one page, we also need to type < script > elements for the javascript code of the Calculator. </div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/htmlJava8.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 9.5 <p>This is where things get a little complicated. First we will create a function called calculate with brackets {}. Each of these brackets will include input variables for the code. Inside the function < var> elements which represent many other mathematical variables are needed. Var num 1 represents the first number after it is in a string while Var num 2 represents the second number after its in a string. Finally we will make many if statements to fit in with the options. If (operation === "math operation" {}. Inside the brackets many codes for each of the operations can be found such as GetElementById.("answerdiv").innerHTML= string(num1) which represents the first number with  string (num2). We are letting the system know that we are taking the first nuber then inputing the math operation we program so that the Javascript will help us solve the operations. </div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/htmlJava9.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 10 <p>Remember we made a < style > tag at the beginning, so now it is time to put it to use. Every element has its own ID, .(ID name) {} will be used like a CSS to edit the page in anyway the user likes. Below is a recommendation of many elements that I chose to be altered. </div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/htmlJava10.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 11 <p>At the end, your calculator website should look something like this.</div>
