        <h2>"This blog was made as a tutorial system to teach even the most inexperienced users about how to make a Hardware page on HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) with CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)!"</h2>
        
    </div></br>

<div class="am-description">STEP 1 <p>I first recommend that users follow this format. It first says < !DOCTYPE.HTML > so that the system knows that this is HTML. Next < html> < head> < body> are all organized in a way so that headings can be made first with paragraphs later. However THIS IS JUST THE SKELETON, you WILL need different codes for different elements such as headings, Paragraphs, etc (< head > < h1 >,< p >, etc...), but do not worry, we will get to those later on. </div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/htmlbegin.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 2 <p> An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document or web page, once it has been parsed into the Document Object Model. HTML is composed of a tree of HTML elements and other nodes, such as text nodes. Each element can have HTML attributes specified. First we will use a < link > < link > element which is a tag that defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. Inside we will link our page to a CSS page. Rel= "stylesheet" is telling the system that we want to link our website to a CSS while we use href= "" to link the CSS website. In href= "styles/ " I typed href="styles/(hardware-styles.css). Now the css page you make will have to be named hardware-styles.css, but we will get to that! This may seem complicated but fairly simple. Also it isn't required to type text between the title elements, but I enjoy naming my work! </p></div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/html2.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 2.5 <p>Now that you linked your first HTML page to a CSS page called hardware-styles.css now you must make the css page! To do that you need to hover your mouse over your files, right click, create a new file, and then name this file "hardware-styles.css or whatever you put for your href="styles/..."</p></div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/html2.5.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 3 <p>The image below is how your workspace should look like. You should have one html that is linked to a Css website that is named the same name that you originally put in your href="styles..." </div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/html3.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 4 <p>As you look at the body element in your html you can see class=... The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element. The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet. Basically when we do this class is used to label a part of your html. The HTML class attribute makes it possible to define equal styles for elements with the same class name. Below I used the < ul > < /ul > to indicate that I am making an ordered list. Inside this list I put many working links. Href= "...html" is used to specify the target in the < a href=" ">. Then add the text that should work as a link. Finally add an < /a> tag to indicate where the link ends. If this sounds too complicated, you can just use the formal below.

</div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/html4.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 5 <p>After all your links are set, you may also add a main heading. However, before I start that, I will add a class= "am-heading" after my < h1 >. Through the class= "am-heading" I am labeling this text as am-heading so I can edit the text it in my css! Inside a < h > </ h > element you may choose a heading such as Hardware.</div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/html5.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 6 <p>This next step is on my CSS page. As I said before, my heading was named "am-heading" so when I typed .am-heading { } I am able to make edits to the heading I chose. I am able to change many things. Every color is made up of a code, so I looked up color codes for HTMl and I found #3A0E0D. With text align: center;, I am able to center my text, and I can pick the font size, font family, and more. Also, another way I can customize my text is with borders. Borders act as bubble like codes that I can place my text over. If it sounds compicated you can see them in later pictures!</div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/html6.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 7 <p>In the CSS page you are also able to change backgrounds with either colors or images! For colors you will need to type background:color (select color) and for images you need to use Background-image: URL(....) I also found many other ways you can customize the fonts of your text. I can add shadows using text-shadow: and change colors!</div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/html7.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 7.5 <p>If you follow my code completely so far, your website should look like this!</div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/html7.5.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 8 <p>This step is on your HTML page. For this we can create a second heading, but before we do that we need to name this text. I first divide this text fromt he other texts with a < div> </ div > element. after the first < div > name this with class= "am-headings". Remember if I want to change texts in the same way they are named same in class="", but if I want to change texts differently, I will use different class=""! Also I used he < br > tag which inserts a single line break. If you want to add a line of space between your text and other texts use < br > Now once all thar is complete you can create a second heading using the < h2 > </ h2 > element. Remember that there are up to 6 headings you can use where each higher number is smaller than the other, ex. < h1 >, < h2>, and so on</div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/html8.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 9 <p>This step is now used on your CSS page! Before I named  my second heading  am-headings so I need to type .am-headings in my CSS page in order to make edits to it. Once I type .am-headings I will also type brackets: { } and I will make changes in those. I can change the text colors, font-style, background color, width, border radius, padding (this edits the size of the bubble-like borders I can make), text align, font size, and font family!</div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/html9.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 10 <p>Now we will focus on making a table on your HTML page. An HTML table is defined with the < table> tag. Inside the table tag we will ass class="am-table" to name the tables for the CSS page. Each table row is defined with the < tr> tag. A table header is defined with the < th> tag. By default, table headings are bold and centered. A table data/cell is defined with the < td > tag. After class= description you can text whatever you want in each of the tables. In addition to adding text, we can also add IMAGES using < td>< img>sc="(link to image)" SC= is how we insert the link to your images into your website. </div> 
<img class="am-images" src="images/html10.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 11 <p>This step is used on your CSS page. Since you named your tables using class="am-tables" we will TYPE .am-tables { }, inside the brackets we can make edits to our tables such as width or border spacing. Below are good recommendations of Border spacing and Widths!  </div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/html11.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 11.5 <p> This is what part of your website should look like! </div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/html11.5.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 12 <p>Now that all of your tables are complete, you can add an inspirational closing quote to your website. First use the < center > < br > elements to tell the system that you want to add line spacing and center your text. Now inside this we will use our paragraph element < p >. Inside the < p > we can also give this text a name using the class= "am-closing" element. From there we can make an inspirational closing! </div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/html12.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 13 <p> This step will be used on your CSS page. For this step can make edits to the closing text by using .am-closing { }. Feel free to customize it anyway you want. I have a font-size, color, border radius, padding, and font family example you can use! </div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/html13.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 14 <p> This step will teach you about how to cite your sources (if you used any). Firt I recommend using < br > between each of your sources to space everything out, because we do not want all our sources to be super congested Now after this  we will use the < a > to cite our sources. Inside < a we will use class= "am-sources to name our sources for CSS. Then we will use href="(site link) > (title of source < / a >. This may be hard at first, but the main thing to remember is to site your source in < a > href="" </ a >  </div>
<img class="am-images" src="images/html14.png" class="Title Jishen">

<div class="am-description">STEP 15 <p> For this final step we will use CSS to edit your cited sources. We will type .am-sources { } , because that is how we named our sources, then inside of { } we can edit them in anyways we want: colors, display, padding, font size, background-colors... and so on. I have suggestions below. </div>

<div class="am-description">STEP 16 <p>Your finished website may look something like this!!!</div>
